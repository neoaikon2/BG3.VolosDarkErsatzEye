# Scroll of Summon Us!  
This is a mod for Baldur's Gate 3, It adds Devil's Sight as an additional effect to the fake eyeball that Rocket...I mean Volo gives you for poking your eye out.  
# Hey! This isn't an *official* D&D 5E item!!  
I know!  
# Then...why did you make this?  
Well Devil's Sight is a powerful ability, most of the time OnlyLocks has it, but I thought the fake eyeball was a good opportunity to give it to non-lock classes.  
# Does this remove See Invisiblity?  
No  
# Installation Instructions  
It's recommended to use  [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), you can find the latest release  [HERE](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases).  
1.  Open BG3ModManager, and drag-and-drop the Zip file onto the window  
2.  The mod should appear as "Whiskeymancy" in the 'Inactive Mods' list, right-click and select 'Allow in Load Order'  
3.  In the top menu-bar, click:  
4.  File ➡ Save Order (Ctrl+S)  
5.  File ➡ Export Order to Game (Ctrl+E)  
  
I don't recommended installing it manually, I wouldn't try to do that and I'm the one that made this mod!
